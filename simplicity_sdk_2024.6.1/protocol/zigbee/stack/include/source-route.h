/** @brief Send a route request packet that creates routes from
 * every node in the network back to this node.
 *
 * This function should be
 * called by an application that wants to communicate with
 * many nodes, for example, a gateway, central monitor, or controller.
 * A device using this function was referred to as an "aggregator" in
 * EmberZNet 2.x and earlier, and is referred to as a "concentrator"
 * in the ZigBee specification and EmberZNet 3.
 *
 * This function enables large scale networks because the other devices
 * do not have to individually perform bandwidth-intensive route discoveries.
 * Instead, when a remote node sends an APS unicast to a concentrator, its
 * network layer automatically delivers a special route record packet first,
 * which lists the network IDs of all intermediate relays.
 * The concentrator can then use source routing to send outbound APS unicasts.
 * (A source routed message is one in which the entire route is listed in
 * the network layer header.) This allows the concentrator to communicate
 * with thousands of devices without requiring large route tables on
 * neighboring nodes.
 *
 * This function is only available in ZigBee Pro (stack profile 2),
 * and cannot be called on end devices. Any router can be a concentrator
 * (not just the coordinator), and there can be multiple concentrators on
 * a network.
 *
 * Note that a concentrator does not automatically obtain routes to all network
 * nodes after calling this function. Remote applications must first initiate
 * an inbound APS unicast.
 *
 * Many-to-one routes are not repaired automatically. Instead, the concentrator
 * application must call this function to rediscover the routes as necessary,
 * for example, upon failure of a retried APS message. This is necessary because
 * there is no scalable one-size-fits-all route repair strategy.
 * A common and recommended strategy is for the concentrator application to
 * refresh the routes by calling this function periodically.
 *
 * @param concentratorType   Must be either ::SL_ZIGBEE_HIGH_RAM_CONCENTRATOR or
 * ::SL_ZIGBEE_LOW_RAM_CONCENTRATOR. The former is used when the caller has
 * enough memory to store source routes for the whole network. In that
 * case, remote nodes stop sending route records once the concentrator has
 * successfully received one. The latter is used when the concentrator
 * has insufficient RAM to store all outbound source routes. In that
 * case, route records are sent to the concentrator prior to every inbound
 * APS unicast.
 *
 * @param radius             The maximum number of hops the route request will be
 * relayed.  A radius of zero is converted to ::SL_ZIGBEE_MAX_HOPS.
 *
 * @return ::SL_STATUS_OK if the route request was successfully submitted to
 * the transmit queue, and ::SL_STATUS_FAIL otherwise.
