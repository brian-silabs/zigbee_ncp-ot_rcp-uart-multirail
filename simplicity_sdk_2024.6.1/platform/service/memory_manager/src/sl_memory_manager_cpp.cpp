 * functions, including C++ static constructors. It allows very early
 * initialization tasks that need to be completed before any dynamic linking
 * or library initialization occurs.
 * The memory manager requires to be initialized prior to any malloc() done
 * in any static constructors. This early initialization applies only for GCC
 * and in that case, sl_memory_init() is not called by the component sl_system.

 * @note The -Wsized-deallocation option in G++ is a warning option related
 *       to C++17 and later versions. This other overloaded version of delete
 *       is recommended by -Wsized-deallocation option for C++17. Indeed,
 *       certain standard containers (e.g. vector, list) with C++17 use a delete
 *       that needs to provide a 'size' parameter. The Memory Manager
 *       does not provide a free() function taking a 'size' parameter. Hence,
 *       the 'size' parameter is simply ignored. When compiling with C++11,
 *       the same containers such as vector, list will use an overloaded delete
 *       without a 'size' parameter.
 *       The -Wsized-deallocation option is used to catch situations where
 *       you might be using the delete operator incorrectly with pointers
 *       that were not allocated with new or that were allocated with a type
 *       that doesn't have a suitable operator delete.
